
Part I

git checkout - b new_branch_name
git branch new_branch_name

What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge? 
fast forwards can only happen if there have not been commits on the original branch 
while the new branch is being worked on

git checkout branch_name
git branch branch_name

git branch -D branch_name

How do merge conflicts happen? 
When Git can not determine what file or folder to choose 
when merging since there have been different commits with changes to the same file
